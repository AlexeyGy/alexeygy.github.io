## 2025-11-05 - Verdichtung

Verdichtung is German word that loosely means "densification". It represents an alternative to urban sprawl that is prevalent in US citizies and has been the dominant strategy for Zurich's expansion.

What it means is that even though there would theoretically new space available on the outskirts, the city, or canton instead, instead of dedicating it to new construction prefers to repurpose existing buildings by increasing the number of floors or by reducing the (often useless) distance between buildings.

I am actually currently living in such a building created from Verdichtung where before this was partially a parking lot and partially an annex of another building.

Short-term, this seems like much less nice than living in a suburban area but long-term this is much more sustainable. Has it been able to meet demands? No. Zurich's rental market is one of the worst in the world or maybe even the worst according to recent studies on real estate bubbles by UBS market re. Are there many alternatives? No. Not really as free areas are sparse and the city is sandwiched between the lake and an airport that is just 10 km away from the city. 

Prices go down steeply the further you move from the gold coast and lakes.


### Zurich's ups and downs

Zurich has a weird history when it comes to it's urban population where its population peeked in the 1970s and only recently reached the same level again.
